The following known issues are present in this release:

  3: Some mount structures do not get labelled - Some mount structures
     are created in unusual ways by the kernel and aren't currently
     labelled.  Policy modules should check for null labels until this
     is resolved.

 10: kextd doesn't like that security.sedarwin has no version - The
     security modules do not currently contain versioning information,
     so when kextd runs warnings are printed, "can't parse version *
     of module security.sedarwin;"

 28: Kernel trap in IOKit when using wireless networking - When using
     prototype and using the Airport device for network access on a
     PowerBook G4, I see a kernel trap involving IOKit modules within
     15 minutes.

 47: Setpmac-spawned processes hang on exit.  The MLS policy does not
     permit a lower-priority shell to wait(2) on the child process.

 52: The fdsec (filesystem) should have labels - The fdesc file system
     provides /dev/fd entries on darwin instead of implementing this
     within devfs.

 66: Panic with a zalloc: the ipctrace seems to be leaking memory with
     port labels and the system will panic after a running for a while.

 76: If a filesystem makes symbolic links from a partition that is
     using extended attributes into a file system that is not using
     extended attributes, the system will eventually deadlock.

 91: Users who create and attach new disk images cannot then access them.

 98: HFS+ ignores mac_associate_vnode_extattr() failure.  HFS+
     currently ignores failures in mac_associate_vnode_extattr(), so a
     failure to load critical extended attributes by a policy might
     leave the vnode accessible.  This may currently be required for
     our system to bootstrap due to our extended attribute
     implementation.  Policies can work around it by setting the label
     to a value that prevents any access if they need to fail closed.

109: Commands 'ls -Z' and 'ps -Z' fail when no mac config file
     present.  If there is no MAC config file present (no
     /etc/mac.conf, and $MAC_CONFFILE not set), using the '-Z' flag on
     the ls or ps command results in 'Bus error'

117: The mpo_check_port_relabel entry point does not hold the task
     label lock.  Policies implmenting this entry point should
     exercise caution.

130: The Mach error returns from the framework don't always map
     well. Most framework entry points return bsd errno values, which
     are not usable as returns from mach calls.  Ideally, the
     framework would return its own private error codes, which could
     be converted to either type by lookup tables.

135: No MAC access control checks in the fsctl() system call.  Darwin
     contains a syscall called fsctl() for doing IOCTL-style
     operations on a filesystem object via a supplied path.  A similar
     syscall does not exist in FreeBSD.  A generic MAC entry point is
     likely needed for this.

136: The hfs_ioctl interface allows unchecked ability to modify the
     filesystem.  hfs_ioctl() allows IOCTL-style commands to be
     performed on an HFS filesystem via the fsctl() syscall and
     VOP_IOCTL vector.  A MAC Framework access control check needs to
     be inserted here.

147: Panic with a bad v_usecount for a vnode during vnreclaim().  This
     occurs under a heavy load of combined auditing and file
     operations.  The stack trace always reflects a problem in the
     lstat() system call.  It's possible that this is a vendor defect.
