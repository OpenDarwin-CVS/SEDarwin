.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I nvram
command allows manipulation of Open Firmware NVRAM variables.  It
can be used to get or set a variable.  It can also be used to print
all of the variables or set a list of variables from a file.
Changes to NVRAM variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown.
.LP
In principle,
.IR name
can be any string.  In practice, not all strings will be accepted.
New World machines can create new variables as desired.  Some variables
require administrator privilege to get or set.
.LP
The given
.IR value
must match the data type required for
.IR name .
Binary data can be set using the %xx notation, where xx is the hex
value of the byte.  The type for new variables is always binary
data.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-p
Print all of the Open Firmware variables.
.TP
.BI \-f " filename"
Set Open Firmware variables from a text file.  The file must be a
list name=value statements.  If the last character of a line is
\\, the value will be continued to the next line.
.SH EXAMPLES

.RS
example% nvram boot-args="-s rd=*hd:10"

Set the boot-args variable to "-s rd=*hd:10".  This would specify
single user mode with the root device in hard drive partition 10.
