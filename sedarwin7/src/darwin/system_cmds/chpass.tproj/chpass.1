.Dt CHPASS 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chpass ,
.Nm chfn ,
.Nm chsh ,
.Nd add or change user database information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a Ar list
.Op Fl p Ar encpass
.Op Fl e Ar expiretime
.Op Fl s Ar newshell
.Op user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
allows editing of the user database information associated
with
.Ar user
or, by default, the current user.
.Pp
The
.Nm chfn ,
and
.Nm chsh
utilities behave identically to
.Nm .
(There is only one program.)
.Pp
The information is formatted and supplied to an editor for changes.
.Pp
Only the information that the user is allowed to change is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
The super-user is allowed to directly supply a user database
entry, in the format specified by
.Xr passwd 5 ,
as an argument.
This argument must be a colon
.Pq Dq \&:
separated list of all the
user database fields, although they may be empty.
[Note that this only changes the user database,
.Li master.passwd Ns .]
.It Fl p
The super-user is allowed to directly supply an encrypted password field,
in the format used by
.Xr crypt 3 ,
as an argument.
[See the discussion in
.Xr getpwent 3
about types of passwords; this option may not be appropriate.]
.It Fl e Ar expiretime
Change the account expire time.
This option is used to set the expire time
from a script as if it was done in the interactive editor.
.It Fl s Ar newshell
Attempt to change the user's shell to
.Ar newshell .
.El
.Pp
Possible display items are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "Other Information:" -compact -offset indent
.It Login:
user's login name
.It Password:
user's encrypted password
[do
.Em not
use this to change a password; use
.Xr passwd 1
instead]
.It Uid:
user's login
.It Gid:
user's login group
.It Class:
user's general classification
.It Change:
password change time
.It Expire:
account expiration time
.It Full Name:
user's real name (*)
.\"user's real name
.\".It Office Location:
.\"user's office location (1)
.\".It Office Phone:
.\"user's office phone (1)
.\".It Home Phone:
.\"user's home phone (1)
.\".It Other Information:
.\"any locally defined parameters for user (1)
.It Home Directory:
user's home directory
.It Shell:
user's login shell
.Pp
.It NOTE(*) -
.\"In the actual master.passwd file, these fields are comma-delimited
.\"fields embedded in the FullName field.
Historically, the so-call
.Qq GECOS
field in the user database entry contain the full name plus other information.
Only the full name is currently supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar login
field is the user name used to access the computer account.
.Pp
The
.Ar password
field contains the encrypted form of the user's password.
Do
.Em not
use this to change a password; use
.Xr passwd 1
instead.
.Pp
The
.Ar uid
field is the number associated with the
.Ar login
field.
Both of these fields should be unique across the system (and often
across a group of systems) as they control file access.
.Pp
While it is possible to have multiple entries with identical login names
and/or identical user id's, it is usually a mistake to do so.  Routines
that manipulate these files will often return only one of the multiple
entries, and that one by random selection.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
field is the group that the user will be placed in at login.
Since
.Bx
supports multiple groups (see
.Xr groups 1 )
this field currently has little special meaning.
This field may be filled in with either a number or a group name (see
.Xr group 5 ) .
.Pp
The
.Ar class
field references class descriptions in
.Pa /etc/login.conf
and is typically used to initialize the user's system resource limits
when they login.
.Pp
The
.Ar change
field is the date by which the password must be changed.
.Pp
The
.Ar expire
field is the date on which the account expires.
.Pp
Both the
.Ar change
and
.Ar expire
fields should be entered in the form
.Dq month day year
where
.Ar month
is the month name (the first three characters are sufficient),
.Ar day
is the day of the month, and
.Ar year
is the year.
.Pp
.\"Five fields are available for storing the user's
.\".Ar full name , office location ,
.\".Ar work
.\"and
.\".Ar home telephone
.\"numbers and finally
.\".Ar other information
.\"which is a single comma delimited string to represent any additional
.\"gcos fields (typically used for site specific user information).
.\"Note that
.\".Xr finger 1
.\"will display the office location and office phone together under the
.\"heading
.\".Ar Office: .
The
.Ar full name
field contains the full name of the user.
.Pp
The user's
.Ar home directory
is the full
.Ux
path name where the user
will be placed at login.
.Pp
The
.Ar shell
field is the command interpreter the user prefers.
If the
.Ar shell
field is empty, the Bourne shell,
.Pa /bin/sh ,
is assumed.
When altering a login shell, and not the super-user, the user
may not change from a non-standard shell or to a non-standard
shell.
Non-standard is defined as a shell not found in
.Pa /etc/shells .
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.
.Sh LOOKUPD AND DIRECTORY SERVICE AWARENESS
User database entries (among other things) are under the control of
.Xr lookupd 8
and may be physically located in many different places, including local
and remote
.Xr netinfo 5
databases, directory service agents such as LDAP servers and flat file databases
such as
.Li master.passwd .
This version of
.Nm
is currently limited to changing user database entries in the flat file
and local netinfo databases.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Xr vi 1
editor will be used unless the environment variable
.Ev EDITOR
is set to
an alternate editor.
When the editor terminates, the information is re-read and used to
update the user database itself.
Only the user, or the super-user, may edit the information associated
with the user.
.Pp
See
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
for an explanation of the impact of setting the
.Ev PW_SCAN_BIG_IDS
environment variable.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/master.passwd -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
the user database
.It Pa /etc/passwd
a Version 7 format password file
.It Pa /etc/chpass.XXXXXX
temporary copy of the password file
.It Pa /etc/shells
the list of approved shells
