.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The
.Nm
command is used to sample and report various cumulative statistic counters
maintained by the operating system.  It can be invoked in two different ways.
.Pp
In the first usage instance,
.Ar n
samples are reported at
.Ar t
second intervals.
If
.Ar n
is not specified, only one sample will be captured.
When the -o option is specified,
.Nm
will write the binary sampling data to the output file specified by
.Ar filename .
.Pp
In the second usage instance, there is no on-going sample interval to specify.
This is because the sampling input comes from a previously recorded, binary activity file.
The binary activity file can be specified using the -f
.Ar filename
option.
When the -f option isn't used,
.Nm
attempts to open a default binary activity file,
/var/log/sa/sadd, where
.Ar dd
represents the current day of the month.
The starting and ending time of the report can be restricted using the -e
and -s options.  Here, the
.Ar time
field is specified in the form hh[:mm[:ss]].
Finally, the -i option can be used to select the sampling interval.  
Only records at least
.Ar seconds
apart will be reported.
When the -i option is not used, all of the previously recorded
interval samples are reported.
.Pp
Due to the nature of on-going sample collection, the data is reported in a
verbose mode when more than one sampling option is specified.
Column headers are printed at the beginning of the report and averages are
printed when the 
.Nm
command terminates.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options restrict the sample set that
.Nm
reports.

Multiple network modes can be specified.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -indent \" Begins a tagged list
.It DEV
The
.Ar DEV
mode reports network device statistics.  The following
information is displayed for each interface.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "Obytes/s" \" Begins a tagged list
.It IFACE
The network interface name.
.It Ipkts/s
The number of packets received per second.
.It Ibytes/s

.It Opkts/s
The number of packets sent per second.
.It Obytes/s
The number of bytes sent per second.
.El
.It EDEV
The
.Ar EDEV
mode reports network device error statistics. The

.El
.It PPP
The
.Ar PPP
mode must be specified in order to display ppp connections
in the network statistics. This will also turn on the PPP modify
mode in
.Ar sadc
(8) when sampling data is not being read from a file.
By default, both the collection and reporting of ppp
statistics is turned off.  See
.Ar sadc
(8).
