.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_securetty
.Nd SecureTTY PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_securetty
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The SecureTTY authentication service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides a null function for session management.
.Ss SecureTTY Authentication Module
The SecureTTY authentication component
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
returns success if the user is attempting to authenticate as superuser,
and the process is attached to a secure TTY.
Alternatively,
if the user is not authenticating as superuser,
the module always returns success.
.Pp
A TTY is defined as secure if its entry is fetchable from
.Pa /etc/ttys
by
.Xr getttynam 3
(see
.Xr ttys 5 ) ,
and the entry (a
.Vt "struct ttyent" )
has the
.Dv TTY_SECURE
flag set.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm no_warn"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm no_warn
suppress warning messages to the user.
These messages include
reasons why the user's
authentication attempt was declined.
