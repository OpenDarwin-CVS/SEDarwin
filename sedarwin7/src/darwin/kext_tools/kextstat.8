.Sh NAME
.Nm kextstat
.Nd display status of dynamically loaded kernel extensions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kextstat
.Op Fl b Ar kext_bundle_id
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl l
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the status of any kernel extensions
currently loaded in the kernel.
The following information is shown for each loaded
kernel extension:
.Bl -tag -width indentXX
.It Index
The load index of the kernel extension (used to track references).
Gaps in the list indicate kernel extensions that have been unloaded.
.It Refs
The number of references to this extension by others.
If nonzero, the extension cannot be unloaded.
.It Address
The address in kernel space where the extension has been loaded.
.It Size
The number of bytes of kernel memory that the extension occupies.
If this is zero, the extension is actually
a built-in part of the kernel
that has a record as an extension for resolving dependencies
among extensions.
.It Wired
The number of wired bytes of kernel memory that the extension occupies.
.It Name
The CFBundleIdentifier of the kernel extension.
.It (Version)
The CFBundleVersion of the kernel extension.
.It <Linked Against>
The index numbers of all other kernel extensions that this extension
has a reference to.
.El
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indentXX
.It Fl b Ar kext_bundle_id
Display the status of only the kernel extension with
the given bundle identifier.
This option trumps the
.Fl k
option;
if both are given and a kernel component is specified,
its information is shown.
.It Fl k
Don't show information for built-in components of the kernel.
.It Fl l
Print the list of loaded kexts only and omit the header
(useful for running output through text-analysis tools).
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits with a status of 0 on success
and with a nonzero status if an error occurs.
