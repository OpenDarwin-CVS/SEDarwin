.Sh NAME
.Nm mkextunpack
.Nd extracts the contents of a multikext (mkext) archive
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl d Ar output_directory
.Ar mkext_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program list the contents of a multikext file,
.Ar mkext_file ,
or unarchives the contents into
.Ar output_directory
(which must exist).
The
.Fl v
option causes
.Nm
to print the name if each kext as it finds them.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Nm
exits with a zero status upon success.
Upon failure, it prints an error message
and exits with a nonzero status.
.Sh SEE ALSO 
.Xr mkextcache 8
.Sh BUGS
The mkext file format doesn't record the original filenames
of the kexts, so
.Nm
has to guess at what they are.
It does this by using the value of the CFBundleExecutable
property of the kext's info dictionary.
(Project Builder sets this to the base name of the kext
bundle by default, but the developer can change it.)
If that property doesn't exist, the last component of the
CFBundleIdentifier is used.
Duplicates have an incrementing index appended to the name.
Kexts that have no executable or CFBundleIdentifier are named
.Dq NameUnknown-n.kext ,
where n is a number.
