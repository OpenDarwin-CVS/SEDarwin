.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B top
program periodically displays a list of processes on the system in sorted order.
The default key for sorting is pid, but other keys can be used instead.
Various output options are available.
.SH OPTIONS
Command line option specifications are processed from left to right.
Options can be specified more than once.
If conflicting options are specified, later specifications override earlier
ones.
This makes it viable to create a shell alias for
.B top
with preferred defaults specified, then override those preferred defaults as
desired on the command line.
.TP
.B \-a
Deprecated, equivalent to
.BR -ca .
.TP
.BI \-c " " "" <mode>
Set event counting mode to
.IR <mode> .
The supported modes are:
.RS
.TP
.B a
Accumulative mode.
Count events cumulatively, starting at the launch of
.BR top .
Calculate CPU usage and CPU time since the launch of
.BR top .
.TP
.B d
Delta mode.
Count events relative to the previous sample.
Calculate CPU usage since the previous sample.
.TP
.B e
Absolute mode.
Count events using absolute counters.
.TP
.B n
Non-event mode (default).
Calculate CPU usage since the previous sample.
.RE
.TP
.B \-d
Deprecated, equivalent to
.BR -cd .
.TP
.B \-e
Deprecated, equivalent to
.BR -ce .
.TP
.B \-F
Do not calculate statistics on shared libraries, also known as frameworks.
This substantially reduces the amount of processor time
.B top
consumes.
.TP
.B \-f
Calculate statistics on shared libraries, also known as frameworks (default).
.TP
.B \-h
Print command line usage information and exit.
.TP
.B \-k
Deprecated (does nothing).
This flag used to turn on memory object reporting for process 0 (kernel_task),
but this is now done by default.
.TP
.B \-L
Use interactive (non-logging) mode.
If not running on a terminal, exit with an error rather than running in
logging mode.
.TP
.BI \-l " " "" <samples>
Use logging mode and display
.I <samples>
samples, even if standard output is a terminal.
0 is treated as infinity.
Rather than redisplaying, output is periodically printed in raw form.
.TP
.BI \-n " " "" <nprocs>
Only display up to
.I <nprocs>
processes.
.I <nprocs>
can be specified as the last command line argument without the
.B -n
flag preceding it.
However, doing so is deprecated command line usage.
.TP
.BI \-O " " "" <skey>
Use
.I <skey>
as a secondary key when ordering the process display.
See
.B -o
for key names
.RB ( pid
is default).
.TP
.BI \-o " " "" <key>
.RS
Order the process display by sorting on
.I <key>
in descending order.
A
.B +
or
.B -
can be prefixed to the key name to specify ascending or descending order,
respectively.
The supported keys are:
.TP
.B command
Command name.
.TP
.B cpu
CPU usage.
.TP
.B pid
Process ID (default).
.TP
.B prt
Number of Mach ports.
.TP
.B reg
Number of memory regions.
.TP
.B rprvt
Resident private address space size.
.TP
.B rshrd
Resident shared address space size.
.TP
.B rsize
Resident memory size.
.TP
.B th
Number of threads.
.TP
.B time
Execution time.
.TP
.B uid
User ID.
.TP
.B username
Username.
.TP
.B vprvt
Private address space size.
.TP
.B vsize
Total memory size.
.RE
.TP
.B \-R
Do not traverse and report the memory object map for each process.
This substantially reduces the amount of processor time
.B top
consumes.
.TP
.B \-r
Traverse and report the memory object map for each process (default).
.TP
.BI \-s " " "" <delay>
Set the delay between updates to
.I <delay>
seconds.
The default delay between updates is 1 second.
.TP
.B \-T
Do not translate uid numbers to usernames (default).
.TP
.B \-t
Translate uid numbers to usernames.
.TP
.BI \-U " " "" <user>
Only display processes owned by
.IR <user> .
Either the username or uid number can be specified.
.TP
.B \-u
Deprecated, equivalent to
.B -ocpu
.BR -Otime .
.TP
.B \-W
Display
.B +
or
.B -
to indicate deltas (default).
.TP
.B \-w
Display delta values, rather than just
.B +
or
.BR - .
.TP
.B \-X
Run in compatibility mode.
.TP
.B \-x
Do not run in compatibility mode (default).
This causes
.B top
to display output in the same format as the version of top included with
Jaguar.
Specifying this flag in combination with options that did not exist in Jaguar's
.B top
may produce meaningless output in some cases.
For documentation on the usage and output of Jaguar's
.BR top ,
see top(1) on a Jaguar system.
When this option is specified, all interactive key bindings are the same as in
Jaguar's top, except that the
.B x
key switches to compatibility mode.
.TP

.B top
display show various global state.
All of the information is labeled.

.SH INTERACTION
When
.B top
is run in interactive mode, it is possible to control the output of
.BR top ,
as well as interactively send signals to processes.
The interactive command syntax is terse.
Each command is one character, followed by 0 to 2 arguments.
Commands that take arguments prompt interactively for the arguments, and where
applicable, the default value is shown in square brackets.
The default value can be selected by leaving the input field blank and pressing
enter.
.B ^G
escapes the interactive argument prompt, and has the same effect as leaving
the input field blank and pressing enter.
.PP
Keypresses that do not correspond to a command cause an immediate sample update.
The following commands are supported:
.TP
.BR ?
Display the help screen.
Any character exits help screen mode.
This command always works, even in the middle of a command.
.TP
.B ^L
Redraw the screen.

.IR <mode> .
The supported modes are:
.RS
