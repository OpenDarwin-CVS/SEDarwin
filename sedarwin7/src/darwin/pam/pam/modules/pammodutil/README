This is a libarary of routines for use by modules. The routines seem
to have a common use for modules, but are not part of libpam and never
will be. They are also a convenient layer of abstraction for providing
thread-safe functions that may require use of pam_handle_t 'data'
items to make their thread-safeness tied to the use of a single
pam_handle_t per thread.

Functions provided so far are all listed in

   include/security/_pam_modutil.h

.
