.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_prepare , mac_prepare_file_label ,
.Nm mac_prepare_ifnet_label , mac_prepare_process_label
.Nd allocate appropriate storage for
.Vt mac_t
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare "mac_t *mac" "char *elements"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_file_label "mac_t *mac"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_ifnet_label "mac_t *mac"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_process_label "mac_t *mac"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
family of functions allocates the appropriate amount of storage and initializes
.Fa *mac
for use by
.Xr mac_get 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_prepare
function accepts a list of policy names as a parameter, and allocates the
storage to fit those label elements accordingly.
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_prepare_file_label ,
.Fn mac_prepare_ifnet_label ,
and
.Fn mac_prepare_process_label
functions allocate the storage to fit file, network interface,
and process labels, respectively.
The default label elements employed by these APIs is configured in
.Xr mac.conf 5 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
