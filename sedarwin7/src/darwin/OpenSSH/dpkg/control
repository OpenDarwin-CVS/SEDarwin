Description: Secure Shell
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a
 network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files
 from one machine to another.  It provides strong authentication and
 secure communications over insecure channels.  It is intended as a
 replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist.
