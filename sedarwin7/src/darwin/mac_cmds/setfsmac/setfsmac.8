.Sh NAME
.Nm setfsmac
.Nd set specific varied MAC labels for trees of file system objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl evx
.Op Fl f Ar specfile
.Op Fl s Ar specfile
.Ar path
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility takes any number of specification files as input and sets the MAC labels on arbitrary file system hierarchies.
Path names specified will be visited in order as given on the command line, and each tree will be traversed in pre-order.
(Generally, it will not be very useful to use relative, instead of absolute, paths.)
The labels that a given file matches will be combined and set in a single transaction.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Treat any filesystems encountered which do not support MAC labelling as errors, instead of warning and skipping past them.
.It Fl f Ar specfile
Add the specifications in
.Ar specfile
as a set of which at most one will be applied to each file traversed per
.Fl f Ar specfile
given.
.It Fl h
Apply
.Ar label
to symbolic links encountered, rather than their targets.
.It Fl s Ar specfile
Add the SEBSD-style specifications in
.Ar specfile
as a set of which at most one will be applied to each file traversed per
.Fl f Ar specfile
given.
The prefix
.Dq sebsd/
will automatically be prepended to the labels in this file, and labels matching
.Dq <<none>>
will be explicitly not relabeled.
.It Fl v
Increase the amount of verbosity.
When given, information detailing the labelling operation is printed while in progress.
.It Fl x
Do not cross recurse into new filesystems when traversing them.
