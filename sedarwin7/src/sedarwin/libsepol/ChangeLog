1.7.13 2005-08-11
	* Improved memory use by SELinux by both reducing the avtab 
	  node size and reducing the number of avtab nodes (by not
	  expanding attributes in TE rules when possible).  Added
	  expand_avtab and expand_cond_av_list functions for use by
	  assertion checker, hierarchy checker, compatibility code,
	  and dispol.  Added new inline ebitmap operators and converted
	  existing users of ebitmaps to the new operators for greater 
	  efficiency.
