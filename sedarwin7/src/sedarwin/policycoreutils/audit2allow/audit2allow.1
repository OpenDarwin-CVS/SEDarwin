.TH AUDIT2ALLOW "1" "January 2005" "Security Enhanced Linux" NSA
.SH NAME
audit2allow \- generate policy allow rules from logs of denied operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B audit2allow
.RI [ options "] "
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-a" | "\-\-all"
Read input from audit and message log, conflicts with -i
.TP
.B "\-d" | "\-\-dmesg"
Read input from output of 
.I /bin/dmesg.
Note that all audit messages are not available via dmesg when
auditd is running; use "ausearch -m avc | audit2allow"  or "-a" instead.
.TP
.B "\-f" | "\-\-fcfile" <File Context File>
Add File Context File to generated Module Package. Requires -M option.
.TP
.B "\-h" | "\-\-help"
Print a short usage message
.TP
.B "\-i  <inputfile>" | "\-\-input <inputfile>"
read input from 
.I <inputfile>
.TP
.B "\-l" | "\-\-lastreload"
read input only after last policy reload
.TP
.B "\-m <modulename>" | "\-\-module <modulename>"
Generate module/require output <modulename>
.TP
.B "\-M <modulename>" 
Generate loadable module package, conflicts with -o
.TP
.B "\-o <outputfile>"  | "\-\-output <outputfile>"
append output to 
.I <outputfile>
.TP
.B "\-r" | "\-\-requires"
Generate require output syntax for loadable modules.
.TP
.B "\-R" | "\-\-reference"
Generate reference policy using installed macros
.TP
.B "\-t "  | "\-\-tefile"
Indicates input file is a te (type enforcement) file.  This can be used to translate old te format to new policy format.
.TP
.B "\-v" | "\-\-verbose"
Turn on verbose output

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility scans the logs for messages logged when the system denied
permission for operations, and generates a snippet of policy rules
which, if loaded into policy, might have allowed those operations to
succeed. However, this utility only generates Type Enforcement (TE) allow 
rules.  Certain permission denials may require other kinds of policy changes,
e.g. adding an attribute to a type declaration to satisfy an existing
constraint, adding a role allow rule, or modifying a constraint.  The
.BR audit2why (8) 
utility may be used to diagnose the reason when it is unclear.
.PP
Care must be exercised while acting on the output of this utility to
ensure that the operations being permitted do not pose a security
threat. Often it is better to define new domains and/or types, or make other
structural changes to narrowly allow an optimal set of operations to
succeed, as opposed to blindly implementing the sometimes broad
changes recommended by this utility.   Certain permission denials are 
not fatal to the application, in which case it may be preferable to
simply suppress logging of the denial via a 'dontaudit' rule rather than
an 'allow' rule.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
.B Using audit2allow to generate monolithic (non-module) policy
$ cd /etc/selinux/$SELINUXTYPE/src/policy
$ cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow >> domains/misc/local.te
$ cat domains/misc/local.te
allow cupsd_config_t unconfined_t:fifo_file { getattr ioctl };
<review domains/misc/local.te and customize as desired>
$ make load

.B Using audit2allow to generate module policy

$ cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m local > local.te
$ cat local.te
module local 1.0;

require {
        role system_r;


        class fifo_file {  getattr ioctl };


        type cupsd_config_t;
        type unconfined_t;
 };


allow cupsd_config_t unconfined_t:fifo_file { getattr ioctl };
<review local.te and customize as desired>

.B Building module policy manually

# Compile the module
$ checkmodule -M -m -o local.mod local.te
# Create the package 
$ semodule_package -o local.pp -m local.mod
# Load the module into the kernel
$ semodule -i local.pp

.B Using audit2allow to generate and build module policy
$ cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M local
Generating type enforcment file: local.te
Compiling policy: checkmodule -M -m -o local.mod local.te
Building package: semodule_package -o local.pp -m local.mod

******************** IMPORTANT ***********************

In order to load this newly created policy package into the kernel,
you are required to execute

semodule -i local.pp
