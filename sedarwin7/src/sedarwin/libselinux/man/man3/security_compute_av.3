.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B security_compute_av
queries whether the policy permits the source context
.B scon
to access the target context
.B tcon
via class
.B tclass
with the
.B requested
access vector. See the cron source for a usage example.

.B security_compute_create
is used to compute a context to use for labeling a new object in a particular
class based on a SID pair.

.B security_compute_relabel
is used to compute the new context to use when relabeling an object, it is used
in the pam_selinux.so source and the newrole source to determine the correct
label for the tty at login time, but can be used for other things.

.B security_compute_user
is used to determine the set of user contexts that can be reached from a
source context. Is mainly used by
.B get_ordered_context_list.

.B checkPasswdAccess
This functions is a helper functions that allows you to check for a permission in the passwd class. checkPasswdAccess uses getprevcon() for the source and target security contexts.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
0 for success and on error -1 is returned.
