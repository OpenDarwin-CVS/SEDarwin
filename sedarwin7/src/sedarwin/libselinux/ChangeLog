1.27.6 2005-10-06

	the load_policy() function in the sysvinit-selinux.patch. 

1.27.5 2005-10-06
	* Added selinux_mkload_policy() function as a higher level interface

	* Merged get_ordered_context_list_with_level() function from
	  Dan Walsh, and added get_default_context_with_level().
	  This allows MLS level selection for users other than the

	* Added public functions to export context translation to
	users of libselinux (selinux_trans_to_raw_context,
	selinux_raw_to_trans_context).

	* Remove special definition for context_range_set; use

1.23.7 2005-04-12

	  rather than assert on a NULL selinux_mnt (i.e. selinuxfs not
	  mounted).

	* Fixed bug in matchpathcon_filespec_destroy.
	
1.23.5 2005-04-05

1.21.5 2005-01-28

1.21.3 2005-01-26
	* Fixed several uses of internal functions to avoid relocations.
