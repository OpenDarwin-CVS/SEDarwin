                 writing and fast crash recovery. The data and meta-data
                 is written in such an order that the only inconsistency
                 on disk can be allocated, but unused blocks or inodes.
                 Thus the file system can be mounted without being
                 checked. Soft updates also increase the speed of
                 updating the file system by requiring fewer writes and
                 hardly any synchronous writes. The paper gives a pretty
                 detailed account of the changes in FFS, discusses the
                 experiences, and provides some empirical results
                 (showing that soft updates can be quite a bit faster
                 than FFS's synchronous metadata updates and close to
                 plain asynchronous updates). The paper also explains
                 how to do snapshots on a conventional file system: A
                 snapshot is a sparse file with the size of the file
                 system; when a block in the file system is written, a
                 copy of the old contents are written into the snapshot.
                 Soft updates uses snapshots for running fsck (to
                 reclaim lost space) and backups while having the file
                 system mounted and writable.",

                 access control policies as rules specified in terms of
                 access control information and context by authorities.
                 Access Control Information (ACI) -- Characteristics or
                 properties of subjects and objects. Their names are
                 used in specifying the rules of the system; their
                 values are used by the access control rules. Access
                 Control Context (ACC) -- Additional information, such
                 as time of day, used in access control decision making.
                 Access Control Authorities (ACA) -- Agents who specify
                 ACI, ACC, and rules. Access Control Rules (ACR) -- The
                 set of formal expressions of policy for adjudicating
                 requests by subjects for access to objects. These four

                 for supporting the wide variety of real-world security
                 policies. Such flexibility requires controlling the
                 propagation of access rights, enforcing fine-grained
                 access rights and supporting the revocation of
                 previously granted access rights. Previous systems are
                 lacking in at least one of these areas. In this paper
                 we present an operating system security architecture
                 that solves these problems. Control over propagation is
                 provided by ensuring that the security policy is
                 consulted for every security decision. This control is
                 achieved without significant performance degradation
                 through the use of a security decision caching
                 mechanism that ensures a consistent view of policy
                 decisions. Both fine-grained access rights and
                 revocation support are provided by mechanisms that are
                 directly integrated into the service-providing
                 components of the system. The architecture is described
                 through its prototype implementation in the Flask
                 microkernel-based operating system, and the policy
                 flexibility of the prototype is evaluated. We present
                 initial evidence that the architecture's impact on both
                 performance and code complexity is modest. Moreover,
                 our architecture is applicable to many other types of
                 operating systems and environments.",
