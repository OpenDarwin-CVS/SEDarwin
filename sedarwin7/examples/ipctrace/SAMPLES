We have included sample results from ipctrace. sample.trace was produced
by running dumptrace right after booting the system. 
The graphs were produced by running
'tr2dot sample.color sample.trace > sample.dot' and
'tr2dot sample.noki sample.trace > sample-less.dot'. Prerendered
graphs are also included.
